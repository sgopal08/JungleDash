## JungleDash

JungleDash is a side-scroller game inspired by the well-known "T-Rex" game on Chrome when you lose internet connection. This game was created using Java and VSCode. 

What started as a project for my AP Computer Science A class, evolved into a passion for game design. Building upon the Java basics learned in class, I dedicated my summer to refining this personal project. My inspiration was the well-known T-Rex Game that appears on google when the internet connection is out. I decided to add my own twist and have it set in a jungle, with the monkey as the sprite character and obstacles being rocks and crocodiles in the jungle. I also utilized array lists and GUIs to create a "banana throwing" feature to defeat the obstacles.
